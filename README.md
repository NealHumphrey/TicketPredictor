# TicketPredictor
Know your risk of getting a ticket if you park illegally on any given street. Uses historic parking ticket data (published by the DC Government) to estimate the likelihood that a meter maid will come to give you a ticket. I'm setting up this project as an excuse to learn some Python and improve my Javascript.
